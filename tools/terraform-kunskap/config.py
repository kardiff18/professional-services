    # There are two slightly different allocation methods that affect how the
    # Commitment charge is allocated:

    # Method 1: Only UTILIZED commitment charges are allocated to projects.
    # (P_method_1_CUD_commitment_cost): Utilized CUD commitment charges are
    # proportionally allocated to each project based on its share of total
    # eligible VM usage during the time increment (P_usage_percentage). Any
    # unutilized commitment cost remains unallocated
    # (BA_unutilized_commitment_cost) and is allocated to the shell project.

    # Method 2: ALL commitment charges are allocated to projects (regardless of
    # utilization). (P_method_2_CUD_commitment_cost): All CUD commitment charges
    # are proportionally allocated to each project based on its share of total
    # eligible VM usage during the time increment (P_usage_percentage). All
    # commitment cost is allocated into the projects proportionally based on the
    # CUD credits that they consumed, even if the commitment is not fully
    # utilized.
